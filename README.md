I am so happy to be part of this current utrains class. I thank you God for putting me in a place i am so finally excited to be. I am looking forward to giving all i've got, through your guidance. I am so happy to be understanding this git stuff . Please fathe, i refuseb to feel overwhelmed, all i want, is just tom have fun  and the rest will come by itself. I know how determined i am when i love a project. i have a feeling that this is the most exciting thing i have been part of recently. And i am not just going without thinking what will be the outcom. I do know that i have the ability and the capability to achieve successfully anything that is humanly possible and even beyond humane as long as i stick to the heavenly father. Who would have thought that this year i will have at least one job as a senior DevOps engineer This is a proof that "Through God, all things are possible"
